- Lazy Loading: Routes are loaded lazily, allowing for faster initial load times.
- Preloading Strategy: A preloading strategy is implemented to load routes ahead of time, improving the overall performance of the application.
- PreloadAllModules: The PreloadAllModules strategy is used to preload all lazy-loaded modules.
- ngx-quicklink: The ngx-quicklink library is employed to prefetch links to improve navigation performance.
- Angular Animations: Animations are added to the application using Angular's built-in animation features.

## Technologies Used

- Angular: The project is built using the Angular framework.
- TypeScript: The programming language used for developing the application.

## Usage

Once the personal blog is running, you can navigate through different sections using the provided navigation links. The blog posts and content will be dynamically loaded based on the selected route.

The application includes the following features:

- Lazy Loading: Routes are loaded lazily, which means that only the necessary modules and components are fetched when navigating to different sections of the blog, resulting in faster loading times.

- Preloading Strategy: The application implements a preloading strategy that ensures the lazy-loaded modules are loaded in the background, improving the overall performance of the blog.

- Prefetching Links: The ngx-quicklink library is utilized to prefetch links on the page, anticipating the user's next actions and proactively loading the required resources.

- Angular Animations: Various animations are incorporated throughout the blog to enhance the visual appeal and provide a smooth user experience.
